# Transaction-Fraud-Detection
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions. Fraud detection is critical for financial institutions to prevent significant losses. By leveraging transaction data, this project aims to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent using various machine learning techniques. The project covers data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning models in identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
